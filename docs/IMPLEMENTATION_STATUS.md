## Headline

All core modules done. Multi-tenant Phase 1.3 complete (per-user MCP auth, contextvars, scheduler). Intervals.icu OAuth Phase 2 complete (Bearer auth, lazy 401 handling, disconnect endpoint, viewer→athlete promotion + mcp_token + auto-sync, rate limit on `/auth/init`). ATP Phase 3 prompt enrichment complete (no cron deviation, see below). Ramp-test Run protocol switched to pace-driven (`%pace` units + `event.target=PACE` auto via `has_pace_steps`); recalibrated to 8-step `80→115%` ladder against pace at HRVT2 (2026-05-08). Drift detection: HRVT2 → Intervals' `lthr`/`threshold_pace`/`ftp` (was HRVT1 — concept bug, FTP added 2026-05-08 per issue #313), latest-ramp-only with `|drift|>5%` AND `R²≥0.7` gate (was 3-sample avg + bootstrap). `get_zones` MCP tool reshape: sport-tagged keys, dual-unit zone objects (issue #313). New CLI: `reprocess-ramp-test` for back-filling `hrvt2_pace`/`hrvt2_power` after migrations `v2c3d4e5f6a7` and `w3d4e5f6a7b8`.

- Fast-path today + settings + goals + 14d-workouts + year-long slow-path.
- `GET /api/auth/backfill-status` + `POST /api/auth/retry-backfill` with dual cooldown 7d/1h + 1h anti-spam rate limit.
- CLI `bootstrap-sync`.
- `scheduler_watchdog_bootstrap` cron every 10 min with 3-kick escalation to `watchdog_exhausted`.
- Empty-import sentinel with 1h cooldown.
- `last_error` allowlist sanitization for UI.
- HRV ordering fix via inline `process_wellness_analysis_sync` in chronological loop.
- Webapp `BackfillSection` progress bar + 7-state button machine.
- See `docs/OAUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SYNC_SPEC.md`.

## Webhook dispatchers — 8/10 implemented

`WELLNESS`, `CALENDAR`, `SPORT_SETTINGS`, `FITNESS`, `APP_SCOPE`, `ACHIEVEMENTS`, `ACTIVITY_UPLOADED`, `ACTIVITY_UPDATED`. Skipped: `ACTIVITY_ANALYZED` (rare, re-analysis only), `ACTIVITY_DELETED`.

### Strava signature (`actor_rename_activity`)

Behind two gates: global kill-switch `STRAVA_SIGNATURE_ENABLED` (in actor) + per-user allowlist `STRAVA_SIGNATURE_USER_IDS` (CSV in env, default `{1}`, checked at dispatch in `_dispatch_activity_uploaded`). Allowlist keeps the queue clean — non-allowlisted tenants don't enqueue 5-min-delayed no-ops every upload. Renames Intervals.icu activities on `ACTIVITY_UPLOADED` with `{sport_emoji} {descriptor}` title (e.g. `🏃 Easy Run 10k`) and a 2-3 sentence AI description (Instagram-card tone) ending with `→ endurai.me`; idempotent via `_SIGNATURE_MARKERS` (`"endurai.me"`, legacy `"Readiness"`).

### Workout card PNG generator

Pillow-based renderer with GPS polyline, AI text via Claude, sport-specific metrics (Run = pace, Ride = power, Swim = pace/100m), endurai.me branding. Triggered via inline button in activity notification; sent via `sendDocument` (not `sendPhoto`) so Telegram preserves PNG transparency.

---

## User-memory facts — Phase 1 complete

Long-term traits via `user_facts` table.

- `UserFact.save_with_cap` append-with-cap — per-topic `TOPIC_CAPS` dict `injury=5` / `health=5` / default 3 + global hard cap 200, race-safe via `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`.
- 5 MCP tools `save_fact` / `list_facts` / `deactivate_fact` / `reactivate_fact` / `get_fact_metrics` in `tracking` group.
- Two-segment cache split in `bot/prompts.py` — `get_static_system_prompt()` + `render_athlete_block(user, language, *, include_facts=True)` each with its own `cache_control: ephemeral` marker so `save_fact` invalidates only the ~240-tok tail, not the ~780-tok static prefix.
- Inline undo-button registry `_UNDOABLE_TOOLS` in `bot/main.py` — `🗑 Забудь это` after `save_fact`, `↩️ Вернуть` after `deactivate_fact`, direct MCP call from `fact_undo` callback without re-inference; TTL = next-chat-msg cleanup + 10-min `job_queue.run_once` fallback.
- Workout handlers widened filter to union with `_UNDOABLE_TOOL_NAMES` so `save_fact` inside `/workout` still surfaces undo.
- See `docs/USER_CONTEXT_SPEC.md`.

## Post-onboarding hey-message (issue #258)

`scheduler_onboarding_hey_job` cron hourly 09:00–21:00 picks athletes with `user_backfill_state.status = 'completed'` AND `finished_at` 24-48h ago AND `hey_message IS NULL`. `actor_send_onboarding_hey` does mark-first via `UserBackfillState.mark_hey_sent` (RETURNING-guarded) so a parallel actor cannot double-send. Text is i18n-localized in `tasks/formatter.py:build_onboarding_hey_message`.

---

## Achievement persistence

`ACTIVITY_ACHIEVEMENTS` webhook now persists `icu_achievements[]` (BEST_POWER PRs with full `point` index span) plus a synthetic `FTP_CHANGE` row when `icu_rolling_ftp_delta != 0` into the new `activity_achievements` table (migration `u1b2c3d4e5f6`). `ActivityAchievement.save_bulk` is idempotent via `UNIQUE(user_id, activity_id, achievement_id)`; raw achievement dict preserved in `extra` JSONB for forward-compat with future Intervals.icu types. Save runs BEFORE Telegram notification — outage doesn't lose data; persistence error is logged + Sentry-captured but doesn't block the realtime ping. Source of truth for the upcoming social-share UI (power PR / FTP-update lists).

---

## Webhook data capture — Phase 1

Migration `b3d4e5f6a7b8`, see `docs/WEBHOOK_DATA_CAPTURE_SPEC.md`. Three new persistence paths:

1. **`activity_weather` table** (FK to activities, populated from ACTIVITY_UPLOADED when `has_weather=True` via `ActivityWeather.upsert_from_dto`).
2. **7 new columns on `activity_details`** (`carbs_used`, `rolling_ftp`, `rolling_ftp_delta`, `rolling_w_prime`, `rolling_p_max`, `ctl_snapshot`, `atl_snapshot`) populated from ACTIVITY_ACHIEVEMENTS via the new `ActivityDetail.patch(_UNSET sentinel)` partial-upsert.
3. **4 MMP columns on `athlete_settings`** (`critical_power`, `w_prime`, `p_max`, `mmp_ftp`) populated from SPORT_SETTINGS_UPDATED.mmp_model — only Ride sport_settings carries the block.

**Skipped from spec:** `trimp` (already on `activity_details`), `achievements_json` (redundant with `activity_achievements` table). **Backfill CLI deferred** — applies on new webhooks going forward; historical rows stay NULL until a separate backfill task lands.

---

## HRV — single-algorithm collapse (issue #307)

Retired the AIEndurance HRV baseline. Code path collapses to a single algorithm — Flatt & Esco.

- `data/metrics.py:rmssd_ai_endurance` deleted.
- `config.HRV_ALGORITHM` env var + `.env.example` line removed (no longer choosing).
- `_actor_calculate_hrv` returns a single `RmssdStatusDTO` (was `dict[Literal["flatt_esco","ai_endurance"], ...]`); `_actor_update_hrv_analysis` writes only the `flatt_esco` row.
- `GET /api/wellness-day` response shape: `hrv` is now the HRV block directly (was `{primary_algorithm, flatt_esco, ai_endurance}`). `HRVData` interface in `webapp/src/api/types.ts` deleted; `WellnessResponse.hrv` now typed as `HRVBlock`.
- `mcp_server/tools/hrv.py:get_hrv_analysis` simplified — drops `algorithm` parameter, returns the Flatt/Esco block at the top level.
- Webapp `Wellness.tsx`: HRV `TabSwitcher` removed; renders `HRVBlockView` directly. `useState`/`TabSwitcher` import dropped.
- `mcp_server/resources/athlete_profile.py`: AIEndurance line removed from prompt-resource text.

**Schema preserved.** `hrv_analysis.algorithm` stays in the composite PK; historical `algorithm='ai_endurance'` rows are not deleted, just never read. Lets us bring the algorithm back as a per-user opt-in later without a migration if the chronic-fatigue use case re-emerges.

**Tests:** `TestRmssdAiEndurance` class deleted from `tests/metrics/test_metrics.py` (3 tests). `TestActorCalculateHrv` and `TestActorUpdateHrvAnalysis` rewritten to single-algo shape (drops 4 dual-algo tests). 99 tests still green in metrics + actors.

---

## Webhook data capture — Phase 2

Migration `c4d5e6f7a8b9`, see `docs/WEBHOOK_DATA_CAPTURE_SPEC.md` Phase 2. Three nullable columns on `activity_details` populated from ACTIVITY_UPLOADED inline:

- `warmup_time_sec` (INT) — `activity.icu_warmup_time`
- `cooldown_time_sec` (INT) — `activity.icu_cooldown_time`
- `polarization_index` (REAL) — `activity.polarization_index`

`ActivityDTO` extended with the three matching optional fields. `ActivityDetail.patch` extended with `_UNSET`-default kwargs. `_dispatch_activity_uploaded` now builds a single `upload_patch` dict (skipping `None`) for trimp + Phase 2 fields and calls `ActivityDetail.patch` once — Phase 1 trimp behavior preserved, three new fields land in the same call. Backfill deferred (spec §6 marks Phase 2 backfill as "⚠ Не срочно"); historical rows stay NULL until a separate backfill PR lands.

---

## Bot-chat gate (issue #266)

`users.bot_chat_initialized` flag tracks whether the user has actually opened a chat with the bot — Login Widget signups land with `False` because Telegram bots can't initiate chats. Set `True` in `bot/main.py:start` and `handle_my_chat_member` MEMBER transition. Read by:

- `TelegramTool._suppress` — skips send when False.
- `POST /api/intervals/auth/init` 412 gate (`{error: "bot_chat_not_initialized", bot_username}`).
- `GET /api/auth/me` for the frontend (`<BotChatBanner/>` sticky banner + `<OnboardingPrompt/>` "press /start" CTA + Settings deep-link).

Self-healing in `tasks/tools.py:_post_with_retries`: 400 with `description ∈ {chat not found, user is deactivated, peer_id_invalid}` clears the flag (guarded — only when failing chat_id matches `self.user.chat_id`, so broadcast typos can't poison the wrong row).

Sentry scrubbing extended with `bot\d+:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{30,}` regex so leaked Telegram URLs in httpx errors get redacted before they hit GitHub-issue auto-creation.

## ATP Phase 3 — personal-patterns prompt enrichment (2026-05-07)

Closing the long-pending Phase 3 finishing work, see `docs/ADAPTIVE_TRAINING_PLAN.md` §3.

- `data/personal_patterns.py` (new) — `compute_personal_patterns(user_id, days_back=90) → dict` aggregator over `training_log`. Always returns `entries_total`/`entries_complete`; aggregate fields populated only at `entries_complete >= MIN_COMPLETE_ENTRIES` (30). Single SQL query, no persistence.
- `mcp_server/tools/training_log.py:get_personal_patterns` — refactored to thin wrapper. Eliminated previous double-query insufficient-data path.
- `bot/prompts.py` — added `_render_personal_patterns` + `{personal_patterns_block}` slot in `_ATHLETE_BLOCK_TEMPLATE`. `render_athlete_block` now fans out `AthleteSettings.get_thresholds`/`AthleteGoal.get_goal_dto`/`AthleteSettings.get_all`/`compute_personal_patterns`/`UserFact.list_active` via `asyncio.gather` (parallel). `_safe_compute_personal_patterns` wraps the patterns coro in try/except — a transient DB error drops the patterns block, never breaks the chat prompt.
- Weekly report already had `get_personal_patterns` in the whitelist; now Claude actually has data to call it on.
- **Deviation from spec:** no cron, no persistence (originally proposed Sunday 18:00 weekly cron + `personal_patterns` table). Compute is sub-millisecond, parallel-fetched with the rest of the athlete block. Doc'd inline in spec §«Периодический анализ» with the rationale.

## Ramp test Run — pace-driven protocol + pipeline fixes (2026-05-07)

Run ramp test rebuilt around pace as control variable (HR/DFA observed). See `docs/ADAPTIVE_TRAINING_PLAN.md` §«Фаза 4».

**Triggers** (`tasks/utils.py:RampTrainingSuggestion`): added `tsb > -10` and `recovery_score >= 70` gates; default `sports = ["Run", "Ride"]` (was Run only). Detector skips deep-fatigue / low-recovery days that produce noisy DFA fits.

**Run protocol** (`data/ramp_tests.py:build_ramp_steps_run`): 10 work steps × 3 min, `pace.units = "%pace"`, ladder 85→130% of athlete's threshold. Replaced fixed-LTHR ladder. Intervals.icu converts `%pace` to absolute pace using athlete's `threshold_pace`; Garmin renders the resulting target on the watch.

**Critical fix:** `data/intervals/dto.py:to_intervals_event` now sets `event.target = "PACE"` automatically when Run/Swim has pace-targeted terminal steps (new `has_pace_steps` property). Without this Intervals.icu defaults to `AUTO` → HR for Run, and Garmin **silently drops** pace cells from the workout step view. Verified live with the owner's account on 2026-05-07.

**Pipeline fixes:**
- **Fix A** — `_is_ramp_test_activity` (`tasks/actors/activities.py`) gains AiWorkout fallback. Defense-in-depth against missed `CALENDAR_UPDATED` webhook; `AiWorkout` is our local record written at `actor_push_workout` time.
- **Fix B** — `_ramp_failure_advice` (`tasks/formatter.py`) emits actionable next-step guidance per `diagnose_hrv_thresholds` code (`too_few_points` → "30+ min work phase", `noisy_fit` → "treadmill", `positive_slope` → "check chest strap", etc.). Surfaces as `💡 {advice}` line under the failure reason.
- **Fix C** — `User.detect_threshold_drift` bootstrap path: single sample with `R²>0.85` and `|drift|>10%` triggers alert. Avoids waiting for sample #2 on stale config (the first ramp test after setup would otherwise be wasted). Mirrored in `build_ramp_test_message` button condition.
- **Fix F** — `actor_update_zones` extended to push Run `THRESHOLD_PACE` alongside `LTHR`. Drift detection runs over `ActivityHrv.hrvt1_pace` (string `"M:SS"`/km, parsed via `parse_pace_to_sec`). Same gating as LTHR (≥2 sample standard / 1 sample bootstrap). Push converts our DB `sec/km` → Intervals.icu API `m/s` via `1000 / sec_per_km`. The "Update zones" button now lights up when either metric drifts.

**OAuth scope impact:** unchanged — `SETTINGS:WRITE` already required for LTHR push, threshold_pace rides on the same scope.

## Ramp drift — HRVT2 mapping fix + latest-only logic + recalibrated protocol (2026-05-08)

Three coupled changes that landed together. Spec context lives in `docs/ADAPTIVE_TRAINING_PLAN.md` §«Threshold drift detection».

**1. HRVT1→HRVT2 semantic fix.** `actor_update_zones` previously pushed `ActivityHrv.hrvt1_hr` (aerobic threshold, DFA α1=0.75) into Intervals.icu's `lthr` field — but Intervals' `lthr` field semantically equals LTHR = HRVT2 = anaerobic threshold (α1=0.50). Result: Z3-Z7 zones in Intervals were calibrated against the wrong physiological point, sliding all training zones ~13% lower than intended (Z4 SubThreshold → effectively Z2 by real load). Fix: drift detector and actor now push **HRVT2 HR** to `lthr` and **pace at HRVT2** to `threshold_pace`. Affected: `data/db/user.py:detect_threshold_drift`, `tasks/actors/athlets.py:actor_update_zones`, `tasks/formatter.py:build_ramp_test_message`.

**2. Latest-only drift detection.** Replaced the `≥2 samples + avg-drift > 5%` standard path + `1 sample bootstrap (R²>0.85, drift>10%)` path with a single rule: **latest valid ramp test, gated by `|drift|>5%` AND `R²≥0.7`**. The 3-sample average was smoothing real progress away (after a successful test that shifted thresholds 8%, the rolling avg with two older samples still showed only 3-4% — under gate). `R²≥0.7` is a gentler quality gate than the bootstrap's 0.85 (R²=0.72 was common in real ramps), but tied to the latest test only — no avg dilution. `DriftAlertDTO`: `measured_avg → measured`, `tests_count` removed.

**3. New schema field — `hrvt2_pace`.** Migration `v2c3d4e5f6a7` adds `activity_hrv.hrvt2_pace` (nullable string, `"M:SS"` format). The DFA detector (`data/hrv_activity.py:detect_hrv_thresholds`) now interpolates pace at both HRVT1 and HRVT2 via the same speed↔HR linear regression that previously yielded only `hrvt1_pace`. Drift detector reads `hrvt2_pace` for the THRESHOLD_PACE alert. Old rows have `hrvt2_pace = NULL` until reprocessed.

**4. Run ramp protocol recalibration.** `data/ramp_tests.py:_RUN_RAMP_PCT` changed from `[85..130]` (10 steps) to `[80..115]` (8 steps), CD shortened 10→7 min. Old protocol implicitly assumed `threshold_pace ≈ HRVT1 pace` (so step 10 at 130% landed near LT2). After the HRVT2 mapping fix, `threshold_pace` IS pace at HRVT2 — step 10 at 130% would translate to ~3:41/km (raw 130% velocity above LT2), unrealistically fast. New ladder: step 5 = 100% = HRVT2 exactly; steps 6-8 (105-115%) push α1 below 0.5 cleanly without forcing a bail-out at unachievable paces. Total workout: 41 min (was 50).

**5. Pace formatting in zones notification.** `tasks/actors/athlets.py:actor_update_zones` now renders `THRESHOLD_PACE` updates as `Threshold pace Run: 4:55/km → 4:47/km` instead of raw seconds. Reuses `tasks.formatter.format_pace` (also consumed by the morning-report drift line in `tasks/actors/reports.py`).

**6. CLI: `reprocess-ramp-test`.** New command `python -m cli reprocess-ramp-test <user_id> <activity_id> [--push]` for back-filling `hrvt2_pace` on existing ramp tests post-migration. Re-runs `detect_hrv_thresholds` against stored `dfa_timeseries` + `work_segments`, patches **only** `hrvt2_pace` (other threshold fields untouched to avoid float-rounding drift). With `--push`, dispatches `actor_update_zones` so the new HRVT2-aligned values flow to Intervals.icu in one shot.

**Migration path for existing users:** apply `v2c3d4e5f6a7`, run `reprocess-ramp-test --push` per-user against their last valid Run ramp activity. The first updated zones notification will show big jumps (e.g. `LTHR 152 → 172`) — intentional, reflecting the corrected HRVT1→HRVT2 mapping.

## Zones tool reshape + FTP drift detection (2026-05-08)

Issue #313 fix. Spec: `docs/ZONES_FIX_SPEC.md`. Two coupled changes shipped in one PR.

**1. `get_zones` MCP tool reshape.** Original tool wrote a single untagged `power_zones` key in a per-sport loop — last sport won, athletes with both Stryd Run power (FTP=366W) and Bike power (FTP=208W) lost one side. Plus `min_w`/`max_w` were emitting raw `%FTP` boundaries from DB (per `data/db/athlete.py:33` units contract) as if they were absolute watts — internally inconsistent. Same shape bug in `pace_zones`. Fix: sport-tagged keys (`power_zones_bike` / `power_zones_run`, `pace_zones_run` / `pace_zones_swim`), dual-unit zone objects with both `min_pct/max_pct` (raw %) and `min_w/max_w` (or `min_sec_per_km`/`min_sec_per_100m`). New helpers `_dual_unit_power_zones` / `_dual_unit_pace_zones` in `mcp_server/tools/zones.py`. Sentinel `999` collapses to «no upper bound» cleanly. Untagged `power_zones`/`pace_zones` keys dropped (no in-repo consumers per Q5 audit). `bot/prompts.py:_zones_block` left alone — already correct (treats power zones as %FTP with explicit `units: %ftp` label).

**2. FTP drift detection — Ride.** Mirrors the LTHR/threshold_pace pattern: pushes `pow at HRVT2` (Coggan FTP ≈ pow at LT2 ≈ pow at HRVT2) to Intervals' `ftp` field. Pushing `hrvt1_power` (older shape) would under-shift cycling zones the same ~13% way HRVT1→`lthr` did.

- New schema column `activity_hrv.hrvt2_power FLOAT NULL` (migration `w3d4e5f6a7b8`, chains off `v2c3d4e5f6a7`).
- Detector (`data/hrv_activity.py`) extends the existing power↔HR regression with a parallel `hrvt2_power` interpolation, gated on `hrvt2_hr_safe` (the bound-checked HRVT2). Upper bound for HRVT2 raised to 800W (HRVT1's 500W ceiling is too tight for strong cyclists at FTP).
- New helper `_drift_alert_ftp(sport, hrvt2_power, r_squared, config_ftp)` in `data/db/user.py`, same `|drift|>5%` ∧ `R²≥0.7` gate. Branch added to `detect_threshold_drift` (Ride only).
- `actor_update_zones` (`tasks/actors/athlets.py`): new elif `metric == "FTP"` → push `client.update_sport_settings(sport, {"ftp": new_value})` + persist locally + notify «FTP Ride: 208 → 240 W».
- Formatter (`tasks/formatter.py:build_ramp_test_message`) shows HRVT2 power on the HRVT2 line and renders «текущий FTP» drift line for Ride ramps.
- MCP tool `activity_hrv` exposes `hrvt2_power` in `get_threshold_analysis` + `get_thresholds_history` (M5 fix continuation).
- CLI `reprocess-ramp-test` patches both `hrvt2_pace` (Run) and `hrvt2_power` (Ride). Idempotent. `--push` only when activity is the latest valid ramp for its sport.

**Test coverage:** `TestDriftAlertHelpers` +5 unit cases (`_drift_alert_ftp`), `TestFtpDrift` +5 integration cases via SQL, `TestActorUpdateZones.test_ftp_alert_pushes_watts`, `TestBuildRampTestMessage` +3 Ride/FTP cases, **new file `tests/mcp/test_zones.py`** (18 tests for the reshape — closes the previously-zero coverage on `get_zones` output shape, surfaced in §2 Q7 audit), **new file `tests/mcp/test_update_zones.py`** (8 tests — closes the Q4 gap where the MCP tool that pushes raw FTP/LTHR had no test coverage).

**Migration path for existing users:** apply `w3d4e5f6a7b8`, run `python -m cli reprocess-ramp-test <user_id> <activity_id> --push` against the latest valid Ride ramp activity. The notification will report «FTP Ride: <old> → <new> W» if drift fires.
